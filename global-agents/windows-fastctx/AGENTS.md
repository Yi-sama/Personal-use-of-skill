## Local file inspection

For reading, searching, and finding local files, prefer the FastCtx MCP
server's own tools — `inspect_local_file`, `grep`, and `glob` — over shell
equivalents such as `cat`/`Get-Content`, `rg`/`findstr`/`Select-String`,
and `dir`/`ls -R`.
Use FastCtx file tools directly for local-file operations, including when a
local reference is URI-shaped; pass the equivalent plain absolute filesystem path.
Read only what the task needs. When you need several files, pass them to
one `inspect_local_file` call as files=[{"path": ...}, ...] instead of one
call per file. The last line of every result says `Complete` or
`Partial` — continue only with the exact parameters a `Partial` note
provides.

### Batch replacement

Use FastCtx's `replace` for mechanical find-and-replace across files.
It preserves each file's encoding and line endings, supports dry-run previews,
and rejects concurrent changes before writing. Use apply_patch for generated
content, semantic rewrites, or small local edits.
